Welcome to **LocateYourWaste**, a revolutionary website dedicated to reducing pollution and fostering personal impact in the bustling city of New York. By leveraging six diverse datasets sourced from NYC Open Data, we've created a comprehensive platform that delivers invaluable information about cleanliness rates, waste tonnage, recycling rates, and special waste drop-off locations. Our mission is twofold: to enhance transparency in accessing NYC's waste information and to empower residents to actively participate in mitigating the waste crisis. This README provides an insightful overview of LocateYourWaste's features and the technologies powering this transformative initiative.

## Project Overview
LocateYourWaste is the culmination of extensive efforts to address NYC's waste management challenges. Key features include:
- **Transparency through Visualization**: Our website generates real-time data visualizations and analyses that shed light on the city's waste and recycling management trends. This transparency facilitates understanding on both a citywide and borough-specific scale.
- **Personal Involvement**: We believe that individual contributions matter. LocateYourWaste empowers users to discover specialized waste drop-off locations throughout the city and in each borough, promoting active participation.

## Pages and Features
LocateYourWaste is organized into four main pages, each offering a unique set of features:
1. **Homepage**: Get acquainted with NYC's waste issue, the project's significance, and the dedicated team behind LocateYourWaste. Learn about the ongoing waste mismanagement problem and how we're striving for change.
2. **Waste in NYC**: Access interactive infographics showcasing the city's annual total waste production from 1990 to 2022. Dive into the breakdown of waste types, borough-wise waste production, and more. Gain insights from borough rankings and sanitation investment details.
3. **Waste by Borough**: Engage with borough-specific data visualizations. Choose a borough to explore annual waste production, recycling rates, street cleanliness ratings, and demographic information. Understand each borough's performance and impact.
4. **Waste Drop-Off Locations**: Utilize our interactive map to locate specialized waste drop-off points. Filter by waste type and borough to find relevant drop-off locations. Access additional information about each location's operational details.

## Datasets
We harnessed the power of six <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/">NYC Open Data</a> datasets through API calls:

- Food Scrap Drop-Off Locations
- Electronics Drop-Off Locations
- Special Waste Drop-Off Locations
- Recycling Rates
- Cleanliness Ratings
- Monthly Tonnage Data

## Technologies
We employed a combination of technologies to create a seamless user experience:
- **Front-End**: Bootstrap framework for responsive and appealing user interfaces.
- **Visualizations**: Chart.js and Matplotlib for generating insightful data visualizations.
- **Data Analysis**: Python Pandas for in-depth data analysis.
- **Back-End**: Flask as the development server, enabling efficient communication between front-end and back-end components.
